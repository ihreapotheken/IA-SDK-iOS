## IACartScreen

* The `IACartScreen` is the primary component exposed by the `IAOrdering` module. 
* It provides a complete, self-managed flow for cart, checkout, and payment. The screen is reactive and integrates seamlessly with other modulesâ€”when a product is added to the cart elsewhere in the app, the cart screen automatically reflects the update.
* It uses pharmacy identifier from prerequisites flow.
  

### Example

`IACartScreen` inside a SwiftUI TabView.

```javascript
TabView {   
    IACartScreen()
        .tabItem { Text("Cart") }
}

```
